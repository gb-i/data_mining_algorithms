## What is this?

This is collection and collaboration of several scripts from people for data analysis algorithms.

## List of Algorithms

| Name of Algorithm | Author |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| [ PENDING ]  | [ PENDING ]  |
| [ PENDING ]  | [ PENDING ]  |

## How to contribute

1. Write your algorithm (or part of it)
2. Choose a neat name for it (NAME in the following)
3. Fork this repository (or with rights: add a branch `alg_NAME`)
4. Create subfolder `src/algorithms/NAME`
5. Add your algorithm to the `menu`-script in the `algorithm`-folder 
6. Add your algorithm to the list above in the following format `NAME | Author`
7. Create a `HowToUse`-file in your main folder
**If your algorithm works:**
8. Create a pull request to merge the data

**Always pay attention: NEVER commit test data, passwords or personal information!**

Have fun... :)
